I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow, UK, following a Master's in Software Development. I completed my undergraduate studies at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. My research interest lies in the exploration of knowledge editing techniques within Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on innovative methods such as locate-then-edit, memory-based knowledge retrieval, Meta Learning, and In-context Learning. I am particularly interested in applying these knowledge-editing strategies to the biomedical domain, aiming to address challenges in editing long-tail biomedical knowledge, domain-specific information, and sequential knowledge editing processes.
