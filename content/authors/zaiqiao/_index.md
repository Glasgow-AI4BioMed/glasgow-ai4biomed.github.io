I am currently a **Lecturer (Assistant Professor)** of the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk), based within the world-leading [Information Retrieval Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/) and [IDA section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/) of [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing). I am also an **Affiliated Lecturer** at the [Language Technology Lab (LTL)](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/) of [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).
Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher (Research Associate) at the [Language Technology Lab (LTL)](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/) of the University of Cambridge; and a Postdoctoral Researcher (Research Assistant) at the [Information Retrieval group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/) of the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). 
<!-- I also have been a visiting PhD student at the [MINE lab](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/mine) of [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en). -->

I am current leading a small research team consisting of PhDs, masters and undergrad students working on Natural Language Processing (particularly **ChatGPT**), Knowledge Extraction, Representation & Reasoning Learning (particularly some BioMedical applications). Students who are interested in working with me, or want to do your PhD with me, please read this [post](https://mengzaiqiao.github.io/post/working-with-me/) for some information.

<!-- I obtained my Ph.D in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in December 2018. -->
