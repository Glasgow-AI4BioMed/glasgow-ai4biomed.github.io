        <h2>PhDs</h2>
        We're very excited to work with students who want to pursue a PhD in the area of AI for biomedical problems. The School of Computing Science has several funding options for students and they are all very competitive, especially for international students. The main application for PhD positions and associated studentships is at the end of January. Information about the application, funding and other aspects can be found on the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/">school's website</a>. Before applying, you should contact one of us (<a href="/author/jake-lever">Jake</a> or <a href="/author/zaiqiao-meng">Zaiqiao</a>) to discuss research ideas.
        
        <h2>Projects for University of Glasgow students</h2>
        Undergraduate students in Computing Science undertake a large project in their fourth year (and fifth year if they are in the MSci programme). We love working with students on these projects and are very happy to hear ideas for self-proposed projects or just to chat about project ideas. Please get in contact well before the start of fourth year to discuss ideas!

        <h2>Postdoctoral opportunities</h2>
        We occasionally have grant-funded positions such as research associates/assistants. We are not currently recruiting for any open positions.
