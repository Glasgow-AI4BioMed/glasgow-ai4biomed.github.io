title: CIViCmine

summary: Precision oncology enables scientists and clinicians to probe the genetics of individual patients' tumours. But the clinical relevance of each mutation can be hard to ascertain and reference to the latest research is often required. The CIViC database aims to curate this expert knowledge. As part of this, the CIViCmine project uses natural language processing to identify mentions of cancer mutations and their clinical impacts. This work was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-019-0686-y">Genome Medicine</a>. The dataset can be explored through <a href="http://bionlp.bcgsc.ca/civicmine/">this web viewer</a>, the code is available at <a href="https://github.com/jakelever/civicmine">GitHub</a> and the dataset is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1472826">Zenodo</a>.
