title: CancerMine

summary: This project uses natural language processing to identify cancer genes and their roles in different cancers (e.g. as drivers, oncogenes or tumor suppressors). This information can be used to help identify important cancer mutations and understanding the underlying genetics of different cancer types. This work was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0422-y">Nature Methods</a>. The dataset can be explored through <a href="http://bionlp.bcgsc.ca/cancermine/">this web viewer</a>, the code is available at <a href="https://github.com/jakelever/cancermine">GitHub</a> and the dataset is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1156241">Zenodo</a>.
